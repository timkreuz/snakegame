Strategy

Keep segments aligned to segment sized grid when the snake turns.

Forget the stripes if it looks weird.

Always add to the tail.

When turn starts, go into turn mode.  This allows the snake to align to the grid before beginning the turn.

It's possible to accumulate turns.  At users risk.

Speed must be be integer of segment size.

When turn begins. Two things happen.
1 - Wait for alignment
2 - Execute the turn
After this turn mode is turned off

Trailing segments will then execute the same turn one after the other.
They will inherit that turn from their leading segment.
Actually they inherit a non-turn.  Whatever the leading segment is doing, they will do.

Another way to do this is not do anything.  The snake stays staionary. And it appears like it moves.

Always add a segment.  Always removing.   This is more straight-forward.

only working on a head and tail at any one moment.

t s s h
in this case we have a snake 3 segments long.  100% tail and 0% head 
then 50% tail and 50% head.  Whatever.  Until we get to 0% tail and 100% head.
When that happens the tail is lopped off.  and a new head is added.  

I like this tons better.
Solves a lot of trouble.  
No stripes though.  although i'm sure there's things that can be done.
